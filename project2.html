                    <p>
                        This project involved developing a standalone Java application that simulates an online e-store using
                        event-driven programming principles. The application allows users to select in-stock items, add them to
                        a shopping cart, calculate totals including tax, generate an invoice, and log transactions to an output
                        file. The system reads inventory data from a CSV file and appends completed transactions to a separate
                        CSV log for record-keeping.
                    </p>
