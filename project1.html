                    <p>
                        Hidden Code is an outreach initiative created to address the lack of girls selecting Computer Science GCSEs and
                        pursuing technology-related career paths. The project involved visiting secondary schools and delivering interactive
                        sessions for Year 9 students (ages 13–14) to introduce digital career options and build confidence through
                        beginner-friendly computer science activities.
